# Syntax highlighting for ER Diagrams

Syntax support in Visual Studio Code for Entity-Relationship Diagram files (.er files) with highlighting for entities, primary keys, comments and more. This has been designed around [Material Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Equinusocio.vsc-material-theme) so stylings might appear different depending on theme.

## Syntax

This is based on the syntax used by [erd-go](https://github.com/kaishuu0123/erd-go/) but also supports cardinalities used by [erd](https://github.com/BurntSushi/erd) and [erdm](https://github.com/unok/erdm).

## Markdown

This extension also provides syntax highlighting and previewing of ER code in Markdown.
